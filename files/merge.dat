 /*
 * Log directory for Windows clients
 *
 * Usage          :  Change the 'str_value' field to a common directory
 *                   into which all merge operations will be logged for
 *                   all users. Should an empty string be specified, log files
 *                   will be written the working directory of the tool
 *                   being used to perform the merge (merge.sh or clarify).
 *
 * Examples       :  On Windows, assume on host PABLO you've shared directory 
 *                   "c:\working\merge\logs" as "\\pablo\mergelog". Specify
 *                   "\\\\pablo\mergelog" for str_value. Set value_type=0.
 *
 *                   Note: Dataex considers "\\" an escape sequence, so you
 *                   must specify "\\\\" to represent "\\".
 *
 *                   On UNIX, assume on all clients that a common file
 *                   system "/nfs/pablo/mergelog" has been mounted. Specify
 *                   "/nfs/pablo/mergelog" for str_value. Set value_type=1.
 * 
 *                   Should you be in an environment with both Windows and
 *                   UNIX clients, you may specify two config_itm's.
 * 
 *                   In both cases, assume that user 'mary' has run the
 *                   merge using the 'merge.sh' tool, and 'jane' has run
 *                   the merge via the Clarify GUI. Log files similar to 
 *                   the following would be created:
 *   
 *                     merge.19971101090923.jane.log
 *                     merge.19971102141314.mary.log
 *                     merge.19971102144502.mary.log
 *
 *                   The naming scheme is merge.YYYYMMDDhhmmss.<user>.log.
